The number guessing game is a classic game that has been around for many years. It is a simple game that is easy to learn, but can be challenging to master. The goal of the game is to guess a number that the computer has randomly generated. The computer will give you hints after each guess, letting you know if your guess was too high or too low. The game is over when you guess the correct number.

This project is a Python implementation of the number guessing game. The code is well-commented and easy to follow. It uses the random module to generate the random number and the input() function to get the user's guess. The code also uses a while loop to keep track of the number of guesses the user has made.

To play the game, clone the repository and open the number_guessing_game.py file in a Python IDE. Then, run the file and follow the instructions on the screen.

Here are the steps on how to play the game:

1. Enter your name.
2. The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. You will have 10 guesses to guess the correct number.
4. After each guess, the computer will give you a hint, letting you know if your guess was too high or too low.
5. If you guess the correct number, you win the game!
6. If you don't guess the correct number within 10 guesses, you lose the game.

I hope you enjoy playing the number guessing game!
